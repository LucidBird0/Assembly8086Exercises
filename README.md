# Assembly8086Exercises
Simple Assembly8086 exercises that everyone can do (with proper explanation).



Why did i create this repository?
I created this as a point of motivation for me to keep learning the language and maybe for others who might see this in the future (even though there is very small probability).

What was my motivation?
I've always wanted to learn Assembly since i found about how the compiling process works (in C++).
I knew that there were many Assembly variants (depending on processors/CPU) and i've started with the first one that stood out in my eyes (that being Assembly 8086, 16-bit cpu, in the x86 family).

Why should you keep reading stuff this repository?
I consider that the "practice makes perfect" and the exercises are the most important thing in learning.
The repository (should have) many ".asm" files which contain the main idea/problem with the solve explained step by step.

How to read this repository?
How you want. Yes, some problems difficulties may vary, but you can read in any order you want.
I will include a number for every file to indicate my experience throughout learning this language (1 being the first project, 2 the second and so on...).
I can't explain everything in every exercise, but i'll put a number representing the file where i've said some words about that thing before.
